# Study overview

In this study, we iteratively redesigned and evaluated a prototype of a consent flow interface for a chatbot that was created to answer customer questions on a U.S. health insurer's website.  The study had three phases designed to assess usability of the prototypes as well as users' comprehension of and attitudes about what they were agreeing to.

**Phase 1** of the study consisted of three rounds of interviews. Between each round of interviews, we made changes to the prototype based on the qualitative findings from the previous round.

In **Phase 2** of the study, we ran a crowdsourced survey on Qualtrics to compare the original version of the prototype (V1) to the versions created based on interview results (V2 and V3).

In **Phase 3**, we ran another Qualtrics survey to compare V3 to a new version that was identical to V3 except for the removal of the word "HIPAA."

Please see the paper for more details about methodology and to read about our findings.

# Summary of repository contents

## prototype_images

This directory contains screenshots that show the main flows (i.e., the paths participants were most likely to take from start to finish) for completing the study tasks with the prototype interfaces. These prototypes were created in Adobe XD and were clickable for participants in a web interface.

Note: We unfortunately cannot share the Adobe XD source files for the study prototypes due to constraints including our agreement with the study sponsor. The interview script documents also contain links to the prototypes that interview participants saw, although these links may not be permanently live in future years because they are reliant on a paid Adobe Creative Cloud license. However, any researchers interested in replicating this study or seeing more details about the XD prototypes should reach out to the corresponding author for more information.

## phase1_interviews

This directory contains the following items:

* The screening survey for the interview phase (exported directly from Qualtrics in .qsf and .docx format)
* The consent form that interview participants filled out before signing up for interview appointments (exported directly from Qualtrics in .qsf and .docx format)
* The interview guides used by interviewers for Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of the interview phase of the study

## phase2_survey1 and phase3_survey2

These directories contain the surveys from Phases 2 and 3 of the study. These files are direct exports from Qualtrics in .qsf and .docx formats.

## hipaa_docs

This directory contains the full text of the HIPAA authorization documents and other documents shown to participants in each version of the prototype.

# License information

The screenshots in the prototype_images directory contain some visual assets belonging to our study sponsor, and we ask that researchers and others refrain from replicating or sharing those without reaching out to us first. We will be happy to work to find a solution with any researchers interested in conducting a replication study.
