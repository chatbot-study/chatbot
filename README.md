# Study overview

In this study, we iteratively redesigned and evaluated a prototype of a consent flow interface for a chatbot that was created to answer customer questions on a U.S. health insurer's website.  The study had three phases designed to assess usability of the prototypes as well as users' comprehension of and attitudes about what they were agreeing to.

In the first phase, we conducted three rounds of interviews. Between each round of interviews, we made changes to the prototype based on the qualitative findings from the previous round.

In the second phase of the study, we ran a crowdsourced survey on Qualtrics to compare the original version of the prototype (V1) to the versions created based on interview results (V2 and V3).

In the third phase of the study, we ran another Qualtrics survey to compare V3 to a new version that was identical to V3 except for the removal of the word "HIPAA."

Please see the paper for more details about methodology and to read about our findings.
